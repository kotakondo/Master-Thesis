Communication delays could introduce serious failure in multiagent systems.
However, most existing state-of-the-art multiagent trajectory planners assume perfect communication and therefore lack a strategy to rectify this issue in real-world environments.
We first show typical communication environments in multiagent systems in real-world environments, and a lack of strategy to address communication delay issues could lead to undesireable collisions.

To address this challenge, ewe then propose Robust MADER (RMADER), a decentralized, asynchronous multiagent trajectory planner robust to communication delay.
By always keeping a collision-free guaranteed trajectory and performing a delay check step, RMADER is able to guarantee safety even under communication delay.
We perform a theoretical analysis of trajectory deconfliction among agents and provide theoretical guarantee of RMADER's capability of deconfliction.

Moreover, we showcase the results of extensive benchmark studies, where RMADER outperforms exsiting state-of-the-art methods, showing a 100\% collision-free success rate. Extensive hardware flight experiments with multiple dynamic obstacles illustrate RMADER's robustness as well as its capability to successfully carry out collision avoidance in dynamic environments.
