\chapter{Conclusion}

We proposed RMADER, a decentralized and asynchronous multiagent trajectory planner that is robust to communication delays. The key property of RMADER is that it guarantees safety even when there are communication delays. RMADER guarantees collision-free trajectories by introducing a delay check mechanism and keeping at least one collision-free trajectory available throughout the planning. Simulation and hardware experiments showed RMADER's robustness to communication delays and capability to deconflict in dynamic environments. Potential future work includes outdoor larger-scale hardware experiments and addressing deadlock issues.
