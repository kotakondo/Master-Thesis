	abstract = {Motivated by recent research on cooperative unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), this paper introduces a new cooperative distributed trajectory optimization approach for systems with independent dynamics but coupled objectives and hard constraints. The overall goal is to develop a distributed approach that solves small subproblems while minimizing a fleet-level objective. In the new algorithm, vehicles solve their subproblems in sequence while generating feasible modifications to the prediction of other vehicles' plans. In order to avoid reproducing the global optimization, the decisions of other vehicles are parameterized using a much smaller number of variables than in the centralized formulation. This reduced number of variables is sufficient to improve the cooperation between vehicles without significantly increasing the computational effort involved. The resulting algorithm is shown to be robustly feasible under the action of unknown but bounded disturbances. Furthermore, the fleet objective function is proven to monotonically decrease as the algorithm cycles through the vehicles in the fleet and over the time. The results from simulations and a hardware experiment demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can improve the fleet objective by temporarily having one vehicle sacrifice its individual objective, showing the cooperative behavior.},

Existing methods for multi-agent trajectory generation often rely on overly conservative constraints to reduce the complexity of this highdimensional planning problem, leading to suboptimal solutions. We propose a novel modular structure for the Bayesian optimization model that consists of multiple Gaussian process surrogate models that represent the dynamic feasibility and collision avoidance constraints. This modular structure alleviates the stark increase in computational cost with problem dimensionality and enables the use of minimal constraints in the joint optimization of the multi-agent trajectories. The efficiency of the algorithm is further improved by introducing a scheme for simultaneous evaluation of the Bayesian optimization acquisition function and random sampling. The modular BayesOpt algorithm was applied to optimize multi-agent trajectories through six unique environments using multi-fidelity evaluations from various data sources. It was found that the resulting trajectories are faster than those obtained from two baseline methods. The optimized trajectories were validated in real-world experiments using four quadcopters that fly within centimeters of each other at speeds up to 7.4 m/s.},

We present a novel method to efficiently produce time-optimal collision-free trajectories in complex non-convex maze-like environments while enforcing nonlinear constraints on velocity, acceleration, jerk, and snap. The approach combines two complementary numerical techniques for optimal control: level set reachability analysis and pseudospectral orthogonal collocation. Applied in a multi-agent prioritized planning framework, the methodology allows for heterogeneous sizes, dynamics, endpoint conditions, and individualized optimization objectives, while achieving linear scaling in computation time relative to the number of vehicles. Simulation examples are shown with up to 26 static obstacles and 32 quadcopters in a tightly constrained space with average computation times of 1-3.5 s per vehicle, depending on scenario complexity.},

	abstract = {In the multi-agent pathfinding problem (MAPF) we are given a set of agents each with respective start and goal positions. The task is to find paths for all agents while avoiding collisions. Most previous work on solving this problem optimally has treated the individual agents as a single 'joint agent' and then applied single-agent search variants of the A* algorithm.In this paper we present the Conflict Based Search (CBS) a new optimal multi-agent pathfinding algorithm. CBS is a two-level algorithm that does not convert the problem into the single 'joint agent' model. At the high level, a search is performed on a Conflict Tree (CT) which is a tree based on conflicts between individual agents. Each node in the CT represents a set of constraints on the motion of the agents. At the low level, fast single-agent searches are performed to satisfy the constraints imposed by the high level CT node. In many cases this two-level formulation enables CBS to examine fewer states than A* while still maintaining optimality. We analyze CBS and show its benefits and drawbacks.Additionally we present the Meta-Agent CBS (MA-CBS) algorithm. MA-CBS is a generalization of CBS. Unlike basic CBS, MA-CBS is not restricted to single-agent searches at the low level. Instead, MA-CBS allows agents to be merged into small groups of joint agents. This mitigates some of the drawbacks of basic CBS and further improves performance. In fact, MA-CBS is a framework that can be built on top of any optimal and complete MAPF solver in order to enhance its performance. Experimental results on various problems show a speedup of up to an order of magnitude over previous approaches.},

Although the Bernstein and B-Spline polynomial bases provide feasible solutions to this problem, the simplexes obtained by these bases are not the smallest possible, which leads to overly conservative results in many CAD (computer-aided design) applications. We first prove that the polynomial basis that solves this problem (MINVO basis) also solves for the n th-degree polynomial curve with largest convex hull enclosed in a given n-simplex. Then, we present a formulation that is independent of the n-simplex or n th-degree polynomial curve given. By using Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) programming, branch and bound, and moment relaxations, we obtain high-quality feasible solutions for any n ∈ N, and prove (numerical) global optimality for n = 1 , 2 , 3 and (numerical) local optimality for n = 4. The results obtained for n = 3 show that, for any given 3 rd-degree polynomial curve in R 3, the MINVO basis is able to obtain an enclosing simplex whose volume is 2.36 and 254.9 times smaller than the ones obtained by the Bernstein and B-Spline bases, respectively. When n = 7, these ratios increase to 902.7 and 2 . 997 ⋅ 1 0 21, respectively. • The MINVO basis finds the smallest n-simplex enclosing a polynomial curve. • The MINVO basis finds the polynomial curve with largest convex hull in an n-simplex. • Improvements up to several orders of magnitude with respect to Bernstein/B-Spline. • Numerical global optimality is proven for n = 1,2,3. • High-quality feasible solutions are obtained for any degree n.},

PANTHER plans trajectories that avoid dynamic obstacles while also keeping them in the sensor field of view (FOV) and minimizing the blur to aid in object tracking. The rotation and translation of the UAV are jointly optimized, which allows PANTHER to fully exploit the differential flatness of multirotors to maximize the PA objective. Real-time performance is achieved by implicitly imposing the underactuated dynamics of the UAV through the Hopf fibration. PANTHER is able to keep the obstacles inside the FOV 7.9 and 1.5 times more than non-PA approaches and PA approaches that decouple translation and yaw, respectively. The projected velocity (and hence the blur) is reduced by 18\% and 34\%, respectively. This leads to average success rates three times larger than state-of-the-art approaches in multi-obstacle avoidance scenarios. The MINVO basis is used to impose low-conservative collision avoidance constraints in position and velocity space. Finally, extensive hardware experiments in unknown dynamic environments with all the computation running onboard are presented, with velocities of up to 5.8 m/s, and with relative velocities (with respect to the obstacles) of up to 6.3 m/s. The only sensors used are an IMU, a forward-facing depth camera, and a downward-facing monocular camera.},

Although a centralized prioritized planning strategy can be used to solve the problem, we rather consider a decentralized variant, which is a more suitable for a robotic system of cooperating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) due to communication limitations, privacy concerns, and a better exploitation of computational resources distributed among the individual robots. However, the existing decentralized prioritized planning algorithm contains synchronization points that all the agents must be able to pass synchronously, which is impractical and inefficient for a real-world deployment of the robotic systems. Therefore, we introduce a new asynchronous decentralized prioritized planning algorithm and show that the method can converge faster than both the synchronous decentralized and centralized algorithms. Further, we demonstrate the applicability of the proposed method as a coordination mechanism within a complex mission planning for a real robotic system consisting of several autonomous UAVs.},

This paper extends the search-based planning approach to address three important scenarios for MAVs navigation: (i) planning safe trajectories in the presence of motion uncertainty; (ii) planning with constraints on field-of-view and (iii) planning in dynamic environments.

	abstract = {This paper presents a multiagent path planning algorithm based on sequential convex programming (SCP) that finds locally optimal trajectories. Previous work using SCP efficiently computes motion plans in convex spaces with no static obstacles. In many scenarios where the spaces are non-convex, previous SCP-based algorithms failed to find feasible solutions because the convex approximation of collision constraints leads to forming a sequence of infeasible optimization problems. This paper addresses this problem by tightening collision constraints incrementally, thus forming a sequence of more relaxed, feasible intermediate optimization problems. We show that the proposed algorithm increases the probability of finding feasible trajectories by 33\% for teams of more than three vehicles in non-convex environments. Further, we show that decoupling the multiagent optimization problem to a number of single-agent optimization problems leads to significant improvement in computational tractability. We develop a decoupled implementation of the proposed algorithm, abbreviated dec-iSCP. We show that dec-iSCP runs 14\% faster and finds feasible trajectories with higher probability than a decoupled implementation of previous SCP-based algorithms. The proposed algorithm is real-time implementable and is validated through hardware experiments on a team of quadrotors.},

	abstract = {High-speed trajectory planning through unknown environments requires algorithmic techniques that enable fast reaction times while maintaining safety as new information about the operating environment is obtained. The requirement of computational tractability typically leads to optimization problems that do not include the obstacle constraints (collision checks are done on the solutions) or use a convex decomposition of the free space and then impose an ad-hoc time allocation scheme for each interval of the trajectory. Moreover, safety guarantees are usually obtained by having a local planner that plans a trajectory with a final “stop” condition in the freeknown space. However, these two decisions typically lead to slow and conservative trajectories. We propose FASTER (Fast and Safe Trajectory Planner) to overcome these issues. FASTER obtains high-speed trajectories by enabling the local planner to optimize in both the free-known and unknown spaces. Safety guarantees are ensured by always having a feasible, safe back-up trajectory in the free-known space at the start of each replanning step. Furthermore, we present a Mixed Integer Quadratic Program formulation in which the solver can choose the trajectory interval allocation, and where a time allocation heuristic is computed efficiently using the result of the previous replanning iteration. This proposed algorithm is tested extensively both in simulation and in real hardware, showing agile flights in unknown cluttered environments with velocities up to 3.6 m/s.},

	abstract = {A new motion planning method for robots in static workspaces is presented. This method proceeds in two phases: a learning phase and a query phase. In the learning phase, a probabilistic roadmap is constructed and stored as a graph whose nodes correspond to collision-free configurations and whose edges correspond to feasible paths between these configurations. These paths are computed using a simple and fast local planner. In the query phase, any given start and goal configurations of the robot are connected to two nodes of the roadmap; the roadmap is then searched for a path joining these two nodes. The method is general and easy to implement. It can be applied to virtually any type of holonomic robot. It requires selecting certain parameters (e.g., the duration of the learning phase) whose values depend on the scene, that is the robot and its workspace. But these values turn out to be relatively easy to choose, Increased efficiency can also be achieved by tailoring some components of the method (e.g., the local planner) to the considered robots. In this paper the method is applied to planar articulated robots with many degrees of freedom. Experimental results show that path planning can be done in a fraction of a second on a contemporary workstation (/spl ap/150 MIPS), after learning for relatively short periods of time (a few dozen seconds).},

In this letter, we propose a new framework for multi-agent planning in a static environment that improves upon the existing state-of-the-art in multiple areas such as computation time, trajectory smoothness, and feasibility. The proposed method first generates a global path that only avoids static obstacles and then generates a Safe Corridor around it. It then extends the notion of Safe Corridors and makes them time-aware in order to account for the future positions of other agents. The time-aware Safe Corridor, along with a local reference trajectory generated from the global path, are used in an Mixed-Integer Quadratic Program/Model Predictive Control formulation that generates a collision-free optimal trajectory. The proposed framework is real-time, decentralized, and synchronous. It is compared to two recent state-of-the-art methods in simulations. It outperforms both methods in robustness as well as feasibility and computation time.},

While solutions using onboard localization address the dependency on external infrastructure, the associated coordination strategies typically lack collision avoidance and scalability. To address these shortcomings, we present a unified pipeline with onboard localization and a distributed, collision-free formation control strategy that scales to a large number of vehicles. Since distributed collision avoidance strategies are known to result in gridlock, we also present a distributed task assignment solution to deconflict vehicles. We experimentally validate our pipeline in simulation and hardware. The results show that our approach for solving the optimization problem associated with formation control gives solutions within seconds in cases where general purpose solvers fail due to high complexity. In addition, our lightweight assignment strategy leads to successful and quicker formation convergence in 96-100\% of all trials, whereas indefinite gridlocks occur without it for 33-50\% of trials. By enabling large-scale, deconflicted coordination, this pipeline should help pave the way for anytime, anywhere deployment of aerial swarms.},

In the presented study, we use the results of such planners and extend them with a local replanning algorithm that can handle unmodeled (possibly dynamic) obstacles while keeping the MAV close to the global trajectory. To ensure that the proposed approach is real-time capable, we maintain information about the environment around the MAV in an occupancy grid stored in a three-dimensional circular buffer, which moves together with a drone, and represent the trajectories by using uniform B-splines. This representation ensures that the trajectory is sufficiently smooth and simultaneously allows for efficient optimization.},

Minimization over collision penalty is also incorporated into the framework, so that formation preservation and obstacle avoidance can be handled simultaneously.

A path-guided optimization (PGO) approach is devised to tackle infeasible local minima, which improves the replanning success rate significantly. A topological path searching algorithm is developed to capture a collection of distinct useful paths in 3-D environments, each of which then guides an independent trajectory optimization.

In this paper, we present RAPTOR, a robust and perception-aware replanning framework to support fast and safe flight. A path-guided optimization (PGO) approach that incorporates multiple topological paths is devised, to ensure finding feasible and high-quality trajectories in very limited time.

A risk-aware trajectory refinement ensures that unknown obstacles which may endanger the quadrotor can be observed earlier and avoid in time. The motion of yaw angle is planned to actively explore the surrounding space that is relevant for safe navigation. The proposed methods are tested extensively.

	abstract = {Civilian drones are soon expected to be used in a wide variety of tasks, such as aerial surveillance, delivery, or monitoring of existing architectures. Nevertheless, their deployment in urban environments has so far been limited. Indeed, in unstructured and highly dynamic scenarios, drones face numerous challenges to navigate autonomously in a feasible and safe way. In contrast to traditional “map-localize-plan” methods, this letter explores a data-driven approach to cope with the above challenges. To accomplish this, we propose DroNet: a convolutional neural network that can safely drive a drone through the streets of a city. Designed as a fast eight-layers residual network, DroNet produces two outputs for each single input image: A steering angle to keep the drone navigating while avoiding obstacles, and a collision probability to let the UAV recognize dangerous situations and promptly react to them. The challenge is however to collect enough data in an unstructured outdoor environment such as a city. Clearly, having an expert pilot providing training trajectories is not an option given the large amount of data required and, above all, the risk that it involves for other vehicles or pedestrians moving in the streets. Therefore, we propose to train a UAV from data collected by cars and bicycles, which, already integrated into the urban environment, would not endanger other vehicles and pedestrians. Although trained on city streets from the viewpoint of urban vehicles, the navigation policy learned by DroNet is highly generalizable. Indeed, it allows a UAV to successfully fly at relative high altitudes and even in indoor environments, such as parking lots and corridors. To share our findings with the robotics community, we publicly release all our datasets, code, and trained networks.},

Nevertheless, computing such a field has much redundancy since the trajectory optimization procedure only covers a very limited subspace of the ESDF updating range. In this paper, an ESDF-free gradient-based planning framework is proposed, which significantly reduces computation time. The main improvement is that the collision term in penalty function is formulated by comparing the colliding trajectory with a collision-free guiding path. The resulting obstacle information will be stored only if the trajectory hits new obstacles, making the planner only extract necessary obstacle information. Then, we lengthen the time allocation if dynamical feasibility is violated. An anisotropic curve fitting algorithm is introduced to adjust higher order derivatives of the trajectory while maintaining the original shape.

Previous work using SCP efficiently computes motion plans in convex spaces with no static obstacles. In many scenarios where the spaces are non-convex, previous SCP-based algorithms failed to find feasible solutions because the convex approximation of collision constraints leads to forming a sequence of infeasible optimization problems. This paper addresses this problem by tightening collision constraints incrementally, thus forming a sequence of more relaxed, feasible intermediate optimization problems. We show that the proposed algorithm increases the probability of finding feasible trajectories by 33\% for teams of more than three vehicles in non-convex environments. Further, we show that decoupling the multiagent optimization problem to a number of single-agent optimization problems leads to significant improvement in computational tractability. We develop a decoupled implementation of the proposed algorithm, abbreviated dec-iSCP. We show that dec-iSCP runs 14\% faster and finds feasible trajectories with higher probability than a decoupled implementation of previous SCP-based algorithms.

	abstract = {This paper presents a real-time game theoretic motion planning approach that enables an autonomous drone to race competitively against an arbitrary number of opponent drones along a 2D or 3D racecourse. Our method computes an approximate Nash equilibrium in the space of robot trajectories to maximally advance the ego robot while taking into account the opponents’ intentions and responses. The core of our solution is a “sensitivity enhanced” iterative best response algorithm that the ego robot uses to repeatedly plan its own trajectory and infer opponents’ trajectories, ultimately seeking a Nash equilibrium in the joint space of trajectories for all the drones. The algorithm includes a term that allows the ego vehicle to gain advantage by exploiting the influence of the ego drone’s trajectory on the adversaries’ objectives through the shared collision avoidance constraints among the vehicles. We also propose two methods for accelerating this computationally intensive iterative algorithm using (i) parallel computing with multiple CPU cores, and (ii) a neural network model that learns to predict trajectories close to the Nash equilibrium through offline training examples. Extensive simulation studies are conducted to benchmark the performance of our game theoretic planner and the statistical results show that our approach largely outperforms a baseline model predictive control algorithm that does not account for the opponents’ reactions. Hardware experiments with 4 quadrotor robots on a 3D racecourse are performed to show the applicability of our method in real-time robotic systems.},

	abstract = {Robotic applications nowadays are widely adopted to enhance operational automation and performance of real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) including Industry 4.0, agriculture, healthcare, and disaster management. These applications are composed of latency-sensitive, data-heavy, and compute-intensive tasks. The robots, however, are constrained in the computational power and storage capacity. The concept of multi-agent cloud robotics enables robot-to-robot cooperation and creates a complementary environment for the robots in executing large-scale applications with the capability to utilize the edge and cloud resources. However, in such a collaborative environment, the optimal resource allocation for robotic tasks is challenging to achieve. Heterogeneous energy consumption rates and application of execution costs associated with the robots and computing instances make it even more complex. In addition, the data transmission delay between local robots, edge nodes, and cloud data centres adversely affects the real-time interactions and impedes service performance guarantee. Taking all these issues into account, this paper comprehensively surveys the state-of-the-art on resource allocation and service provisioning in multi-agent cloud robotics. The paper presents the application domains of multi-agent cloud robotics through explicit comparison with the contemporary computing paradigms and identifies the specific research challenges. A complete taxonomy on resource allocation is presented for the first time, together with the discussion of resource pooling, computation offloading, and task scheduling for efficient service provisioning. Furthermore, we highlight the research gaps from the learned lessons, and present future directions deemed beneficial to further advance this emerging field.},

	abstract = {The goal of this work is to enable a team of quadrotors to learn how to accurately track a desired trajectory while holding a given formation. We solve this problem in a distributed manner, where each vehicle has only access to the information of its neighbors. The desired trajectory is only available to one (or few) vehicle(s). We present a distributed iterative learning control (ILC) approach where each vehicle learns from the experience of its own and its neighbors’ previous task repetitions and adapts its feedforward input to improve performance. Existing algorithms are extended in theory to make them more applicable to real-world experiments. In particular, we prove convergence of the learning scheme for any linear, causal learning function with gains chosen according to a simple scalar condition. Previous proofs were restricted to a specific learning function, which only depends on the tracking error derivative (D-type ILC). This extension provides more degrees of freedom in the ILC design and, as a result, better performance can be achieved. We also show that stability is not affected by a linear dynamic coupling between neighbors. This allows the use of an additional consensus feedback controller to compensate for non-repetitive disturbances. Possible robustness extensions for the ILC algorithm are discussed, the so-called Q-filter and a Kalman filter for disturbance estimation. Finally, this is the first work to show distributed ILC in experiment. With a team of two quadrotors, the practical applicability of the proposed distributed multi-agent ILC approach is attested and the benefits of the theoretic extension are analyzed. In a second experimental setup with a team of four quadrotors, we evaluate the impact of different communication graph structures on the learning performance. The results indicate, that there is a trade-off between fast learning convergence and formation synchronicity, especially during the first iterations.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the problem of the trajectory design for a group of energy-constrained drones operating in dynamic wireless network environments is studied. In the considered model, a team of drone base stations (DBSs) is dispatched to cooperatively serve clusters of ground users that have dynamic and unpredictable uplink access demands. In this scenario, the DBSs must cooperatively navigate in the considered area to maximize coverage of the dynamic requests of the ground users. This trajectory design problem is posed as an optimization framework whose goal is to find optimal trajectories that maximize the fraction of users served by all DBSs. To find an optimal solution for this non-convex optimization problem under unpredictable environments, a value decomposition based reinforcement learning (VD-RL) solution coupled with a meta-training mechanism is proposed. This algorithm allows the DBSs to dynamically learn their trajectories while generalizing their learning to unseen environments. Analytical results show that, the proposed VD-RL algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a locally optimal solution of the non-convex optimization problem. Simulation results show that, even without meta-training, the proposed VD-RL algorithm can achieve a 53.2\% improvement of the service coverage and a 30.6\% improvement in terms of the convergence speed, compared to baseline multi-agent algorithms. Meanwhile, the use of the meta-training mechanism improves the convergence speed of the VD-RL algorithm by up to 53.8\% when the DBSs must deal with a previously unseen task.},

Hence, we investigate a novel method of switching time-invariant formation control for a group of heterogeneous autonomous vehicles, which may include Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGV) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). We have extended a Negative Imaginary (NI) consensus control approach to switch the formation shape of the robots whilst only using the relative distances between agents, in combination with those between agents and obstacles. All agents can automatically create a new safe formation to overcome obstacles, then restore the prototype formation once the obstacles are cleared. We address the oscillation and local minima problems, generated by existing algorithms, using a newly developed circle fitting approach. We also highlight the advantages of our proposed algorithms over the kinematic controller and the conventional Artificial Potential Field (APF) controller from both theoretical and experimental standpoints. Simulation and experimental results are then analyzed to validate the feasibility of our proposed approach.},

Centralized methods suffer from scale dilemmas, while decentralized ones often lead to poor planning quality. In this paper, we propose an enhanced decentralized autonomous aerial swarm system with group planning. According to the spatial distribution of agents, the system dynamically divides the swarm into several groups and isolated agents. For conflicts within each group, we propose a novel coordination mechanism named group planning. The group planning consists of efficient multi-agent pathfinding and trajectory joint optimization, which can significantly improve the planning quality and success rate. We demonstrate simulations and real-world experiments that our method not only has applicability for a large-scale swarm, but also has top-level planning quality.},

However, real-time and stability remain a significant challenge in the field of path planning. To improve the robustness and efficiency of the path planning method in complex environments, this paper presents RETRBG, a robust and efficient trajectory replanning method based on the guiding path. Firstly, a safe guiding path is generated by using an improved A* and path pruning method, which is used to perceive the narrow space in its surrounding environment. Secondly, under the guidance of the path, a guided kinodynamic path searching method (GKPS) is devised to generate a safe, kinodynamically feasible and minimum-time initial path. Finally, an adaptive optimization function with two modes is proposed to improve the optimization quality in complex environments, which selects the optimization mode to optimize the smoothness and safety of the path according to the perception results of the guiding path. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieved good performance both in different obstacle densities and different resolutions. Compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, the quality and success rate of the planning result are significantly improved.},

It repeatedly finds shortest paths from a given start vertex to a given goal vertex while the edge costs of a graph change or vertices are added or deleted. Its first search is the same as that of a version of A∗ that breaks ties in favor of vertices with smaller g-values but many of the subsequent searches are potentially faster because it reuses those parts of the previous search tree that are identical to the new one.

	abstract = {The task of planning trajectories for a mobile robot has received considerable attention in the research literature. Most of the work assumes the robot has a complete and accurate model of its environment before it begins to move; less attention has been paid to the problem of partially known environments. This situation occurs for an exploratory robot or one that must move to a goal location without the benefit of a floorplan or terrain map. Existing approaches plan an initial path based on known information and then modify the plan locally or replan the entire path as the robot discovers obstacles with its sensors, sacrificing optimality or computational efficiency respectively. This paper introduces a new algorithm, D*, capable of planning paths in unknown, partially known, and changing environments in an efficient, optimal, and complete manner.{\textless}{\textgreater}},
